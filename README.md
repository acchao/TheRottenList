Time to complete
~12 hours

 Assignment 1
 Required Tasks:
 * [x] User can view a list of movies from Rotten Tomatoes. Poster images must be loading asynchronously
 * [x] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell
 * [x] User sees loading state while waiting for movies API. You can use one of the 3rd party libraries atcocoacontrols.com.
 * [x]  User sees error message when there's a networking error. You may not use UIAlertView to display the error. See this screenshot for what the error message should look like: network error screenshot.
 * [x]  User can pull to refresh the movie list.
 
 Optional
 * [x] For the large poster, load the low-res image first, switch to high-res when complete
 * [x] Customize the navigation bar.
 
 * All images should be cached in memory and disk. In other words, images load immediately upon cold start 
 * Customize the highlight and selection effect of the cell.
 * All images fade in 
 * Add a tab bar for Box Office and DVD.
 * Add a search bar.

I also messed around with scrollviews as a nonlisted optional task.
